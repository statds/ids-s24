# Introduction

## What Is Data Science?

Data science is a multifaceted field, often conceptualized as resting
on three fundamental pillars: mathematics/statistics, computer
science, and domain-specific knowledge. This framework helps to
underscore the interdisciplinary nature of data science, where
expertise in one area is often complemented by foundational knowledge
in the others.


A compelling definition was offered by Prof. Bin Yu in her 2014
Presidential Address to the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.
She defines
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{Data Science} =
\mbox{S}\mbox{D}\mbox{C}^3,
\end{equation*}
where

+ 'S' represents Statistics, signifying the crucial role of
statistical methods in understanding and interpreting data;
+ 'D' stands for domain or science knowledge, indicating the
importance of specialized expertise in a particular field of study;
+ the three 'C's denotes computing, collaboration/teamwork, and
communication to outsiders.

Computing underscores the need for proficiency in programming and
algorithmic thinking, collaboration/teamwork reflects the inherently
collaborative nature of data science projects, often requiring teams
with diverse skill sets, and communication to outsiders emphasizes the
importance of translating complex data insights into understandable
and actionable information for non-experts.


This definition neatly captures the essence of data science,
emphasizing a balance between technical skills, teamwork, and the
ability to communicate effectively.


## Expectations from This Course

In this course, students will be expected to achieve the following outcomes:

- **Proficiency in Project Management with Git**: Develop a solid
    understanding of Git for efficient and effective project
    management. This involves mastering version control, branching,
    and collaboration through this powerful tool.


- **Proficiency in Project Reporting with Quarto**: Gain expertise in
    using Quarto for professional-grade project reporting. This
    encompasses creating comprehensive and visually appealing reports
    that effectively communicate your findings.
    

- **Hands-On Experience with Real-World Data Science Projects**:
    Engage in practical data science projects that reflect real-world
    scenarios. This hands-on approach is designed to provide you with
    direct experience in tackling actual data science challenges.
    

- **Competency in Using Python and Its Extensions for Data Science**:
    Build strong skills in Python, focusing on its extensions relevant
    to data science. This includes libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and
    Matplotlib, among others, which are critical for data analysis and
    visualization.
    

- **Full Grasp of the Meaning of Results from Data Science Algorithms**:
    Learn to not only apply data science algorithms but
    also to deeply understand the implications and meanings of their
    results. This is crucial for making informed decisions based on
    these outcomes.
    

- **Basic Understanding of the Principles of Data Science Methods**:
    Acquire a foundational knowledge of the underlying principles of
    various data science methods. This understanding is key to
    effectively applying these methods in practice.
    

- **Commitment to the Ethics of Data Science**: Emphasize the
    importance of ethical considerations in data science. This
    includes understanding data privacy, bias in data and algorithms,
    and the broader social implications of data science work.
    

## Computing Environment

All setups are operating system dependent. As soon as possible, stay away from
Windows. Otherwise, good luck (you will need it).

### Command Line Interface

On Linux or MacOS, simply open a terminal.

On Windows, several options can be considered.

+ Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL): <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/>
+ Cygwin (with X): <https://x.cygwin.com>
+ Git Bash: <https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/what-is-git-bash>

To jump start, here is a tutorial:
[Ubunto Linux for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners).

At least, you need to know how to handle files and traverse across
directories. The tab completion and introspection supports are very useful.


### Python

Set up Python on your computer:

- Python 3.
- Python package manager __miniconda__ or __pip__.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Jupyter Notebook; RStudio; VS Code; Emacs; etc.)

I will be using IPython and Jupyter Notebook in class.

Readability is important!
Check your Python coding styles against the recommended styles:
<https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>. A good place to start is the Section on
"Code Lay-out".
