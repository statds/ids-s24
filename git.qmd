# Project Management {#sec-git}

Many tutorials are available in different formats. Here is a [YouTube video
``Git and GitHub for Beginners --- Crash
Course''](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk).
The video also covers GitHub, a cloud service for Git which provides a cloud
back up of your work and makes collaboration with co-workers easy. Similar
services are, for example, [bitbucket](bitbucket.org) and [GitLab](gitlab.com).


Here is a collection of [online Git exersices](https://gitexercises.fracz.com)
that I used for Git training in other courses that I taught.


## Set Up

To set up GitHub (other services like Bitbucket or GitLab are similar), you need to

+ Generate an SSH key if you don't have one already.
+ Sign up an GitHub account.
+ Add the SSH key to your GitHub account


## Most Frequently Used Git Commands

+ `git clone`
+ `git pull`
+ `git status`
+ `git add`
+ `git remove`
+ `git commit`
+ `git push`

## Tips on using Git:

+ Use the command line interface instead of the web interface (e.g., upload on GitHub)
+ Make frequent small commits instead of rare large commits.
+ Make commit messages informative and meaningful.
+ Name your files/folders by some reasonable convention. 
    - Lower cases are better than upper cases.
    - No blanks in file/folder names.
+ Keep the repo clean by not tracking generated files.
+ Creat a `.gitignore` file for better output from `git status`.
+ Keep the linewidth of sources to under 80 for better `git diff` view.


## Pull Request
To contribute to an open source project (e.g., our classnotes), use pull
requests. [Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
"let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on
GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential
changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are
merged into the base branch."
