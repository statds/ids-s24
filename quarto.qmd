# Reproducibile Data Science {#sec-quarto}

Data science projects should be reproducible to be trustworthy. Dynamic
documents facilitate reproducibility. [Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an
open-source dynamic document preparation system, ideal for scientific and
technical publishing. From the official websites, Quarto can be used to:

+ Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
+ Author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks.
+ Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and
  books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
+ Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs,
  figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.
  
Of course, Quarto can be used to write homework, exams, and reports in this
course.


To get started, see documentation at
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

A template for homework is in this repo: `hwtemp.qmd`.
