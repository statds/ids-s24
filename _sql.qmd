## Introduction

Today, I will be presenting on Database Operations using SQL and I will demonstrate 
it by using sqlite3 in Python and I will use our cleaned rodent data set. This 
presentation will briefly go over what Professor Haim Bar talked about during his 
talk and we will dive into some more advanced SQL commands. 

## What is SQL?

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. It is used within relational database management systems such as MS SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, etc... to perform CRUD operations.

### CRUD

+ [C]{.underline}reate - inserting new records/values

**INSERT INTO** table_name **VALUES** (field value 1, field value 2, ...) 

+ [R]{.underline}ead - searching for records

**SELECT** field 1, field2, ... **FROM** table_name [**WHERE** condition]

+ [U]{.underline}pdate - modifying existing records

**UPDATE** table_name **SET** field1=value1, field2=value2, ... [**WHERE** condition]

+ [D]{.underline}elete - removing existing records

**DELETE** **FROM** table_name [**WHERE** condition]

### RDBMS vs NoSQL

RDBMS

+ Basis for SQL
+ Models relationships in "Tables"
+ Rows and Columns (Record/Fields)
+ MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL
+ Two tables can be linked if they have a matching field

NoSQL 

+ "Not only" SQL or Non-SQL
+ Great with large data sets
+ Key / Value Pairs
+ Does not always use SQL
+ AWS DynamoDB

## Recap and Overview of some Basics

### Key Notes from Professor Bar

#### Creating Tables

```
CREATE TABLE contacts(
	contact_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
	last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
	email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	phone TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
```
+ Creates a table named *contacts*.
+ Five fields: contact_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone
+ PRIMARY KEY: uniquely identifies each record in the table.
+ Some columns will store character data while others will store integer data.
+ NOT NULL: Columns **cannot** be empty.
+ UNIQUE: All values in this specific column have to be different from each other. 

```
CREATE TABLE contact_groups (
	contact_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	group_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	PRIMARY KEY(contact_id, group_id)
	FOREIGN KEY(contact_id)
		REFERENCES contacts (contact_id)
			ON DELETE CASCADE
			ON UPDATE NO ACTION,
	FOREIGN KEY(group_id)
		REFERENCES groups (group_Id)
			ON DELETE CASCADE
			ON UPDATE NO ACTION
);
```
+ PRIMARY KEY() declares which variables are primary keys. We should remove the first two *Primary Key* declarations to have proper syntax.
+ FOREIGN KEY() declares the variable as a foreign key
    + A constraint that is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
    + A field in one table that refers to a different `PRIMARY KEY` in another table. 
    + Table with a foreign key is a child table.
    + Prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column because it has to be a value contained in the parent table.
+ ON DELETE CASECADE: If a record in `contacts` is deleted, any corresponding records in `contact_groups` will also be deleted.
+ ON UPDATE NO ACTION: If a `contact_id` in `contacts` is updated, no action will be taken on `contact_groups`.
    + Can be replaced with `RESTRICT`.

#### Inserting and Searching

```
INSERT INTO artists (name). VALUES('Bud Powell')
INSERT INTO artists (name)
VALUES
	('Buddy Rich')
	('Example 2')
 ```

 + Multiple ways to insert values into a specific table.

**Connecting to SQLite3 Using Python**

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# Connects to Database
conn = sqlite3.connect("presentation.db")

# Using our cleaned rodent data
data = pd.read_feather("data/rodent_2022-2023.feather")
```

```{python}
# Creates Rodent table
data.to_sql(
            'rodent', # Name of SQL table
            conn, # sqlite3 connection
            if_exists = 'replace',
            index = False
)

# Cursor
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Executing example statement to show functionality
cursor.execute("""
                SELECT *
                FROM rodent
                LIMIT 5
               """)
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Column names
columns = [description[0] for description in cursor.description]

# Displaying the output in a table format
pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=columns)
```
