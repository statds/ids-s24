# Preliminaries {.unnumbered}

The notets were developed with Quarto; for details about Quarto, visit
<https://quarto.org/docs/books>.


## Sources at GitHub
These lecture notes for STAT 3255/5255 in Spring 2024 represent a
collaborative effort between Professor Jun Yan and the students
enrolled in the course. This cooperative approach to education was
facilitated through the use of GitHub, a platform that encourages
collaborative coding and content development.


Students contributed to the lecture notes by submitting pull requests
to our dedicated GitHub repository. This method not only enriched the
course material but also provided students with practical experience
in collaborative software development and version control. To view
these contributions and the lecture notes in their entirety, please
visit our Spring 2024 repository at <https://github.com/statds/ids-s24>.


For those interested in exploring the lecture notes from the previous
years, the [Spring 2023](https://github.com/statds/ids-s23) and
[Spring 2024](https://github.com/statds/ids-s22)
are both publicly accessible. These archives offer
valuable insights into the evolution of the course content and the
different perspectives brought by successive student cohorts.

## Midterm Project

Our mid-term project on rat sightings in New York City is to be
showcased in a virtual session at the NYC Open Data Week, 2024, the
week following the Spring Break. Four students will be selected to
present topics on the mid-term project.

## Final Project

Students are encouraged to start designing their final projects from
the beginning of the semester. There are many open data that can be
used. Here is a list of data challenges that you may find useful:

+ [ASA Data Challenge Expo](https://community.amstat.org/dataexpo/home)
+ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
+ [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org)
+ [Top 10 Data Science Competitions in
  2024](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/data-science-competitions)

If you work on sports analytics, you are welcome to submit a
poster to [UConn Sports Analytics Symposium
(UCSAS) 2024](https://statds.org/events/ucsas2024/).


## Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition

In this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a
critical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this
insightful quote from @vanderplas2016python:

> When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member,
> or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of
> knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown
> answer. In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online
> documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a
> wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found
> yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is
> less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible
> situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you
> don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.

This quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our
students: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast
resources available to solve complex problems in data science.

              "Harris, Joe"]

import random
random.seed(71323498112697523) # jointly set by the class on 01/30/2023
random.sample(presenters, len(presenters))
```

### Contributing to the Class Notes

Contribution to the class notes is through a `pull request'.

+ Start a new branch and switch to the new branch.
+ On the new branch, add a qmd file for your presentation
+ Edit `_quarto.yml` add a line for your qmd file to include it in the notes.
+ Work on your qmd file, test with `quarto render`.
+ When satisfied, commit and make a pull request.

I have added a template file `mysection.qmd` and a new line to `_quarto.yml`
as an example.

For more detailed style guidance, please see my notes on [statistical
wrirting](https://statds.github.io/stat-writing/using-the-right-tools-for-writing.html#latex-for-typesetting).


Plagiarism is to be prevented. Remember that these class notes are publicly
available online with your names attached.  Here are some resources on []how to
avoid plagiarism](https://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu/how-avoid-plagiarism). 
In particular, in our course, one convenient way to avoid plagiarism is to use
our own data (e.g., NYC Open Data). Combined with your own explanation of the
code chunks, it would be hard to plagiarize.


### Homework Requirements

+ Use the repo from Git Classroom to submit your work. See @sec-git.
    - Keep the repo clean (no tracking generated files).
	- Never "Upload" your files; use the git command lines.
	- Make commit message informative (think about the readers).
+ Use `quarto` source only. See @sec-quarto.
+ For the conveinence of greading, add your html output to a release in your
  repo.


## Practical Tips

### Data analysis

+ Use an IDE so you can play with the data interactively
+ Collect codes that have tested out into a script for batch processing
+ During data cleaning, keep in mind how each variable will be used later
+ No keeping large data files in a repo; assume a reasonable location with your collaborators

### Presentation

+ Don't forget to introduce yourself if there is no moderator
+ Highlight your research questions and results, not code
+ Give an outline, carry it out, and summarize
