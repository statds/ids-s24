# Data Import/Export

Working with data is a fundamental aspect of data science in Python,
with data import and export being crucial skills. Throughout, we will
use the 311 service request data for illustrations, downloaded from
the NYC Open Data as a `csv` file.

## Using the `Pandas` Package

The pandas library simplifies data manipulation and analysis. It's
especially handy for dealing with CSV files.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
import pandas as pd

# Define the file name
csvnm = "data/rodent_22_23.csv"

# Specify the strings that indicate missing values
# Q: How would you know these?
na_values = [
    "",
    "0 Unspecified",
    "N/A",
    "na",
    "na na",
    "Unspecified",
    "UNKNOWN",
]

def custom_date_parser(x):
    return pd.to_datetime(x, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", errors='coerce')

# Read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv(
    csvnm,
    na_values=na_values,
    parse_dates=['Created Date', 'Closed Date'],  # Specify the date columns to parse
    date_parser=custom_date_parser,
    dtype={'Latitude': 'float32', 'Longitude': 'float32'},
)

# Drop the 'Location' since it is redundant
# df.drop(columns=['Location'], inplace=True)

# Strip leading and trailing whitespace from the column names
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()
df.columns = df.columns.str.replace(' ', '_', regex=False).str.lower()
```


The `pandas` package also provides some utility functions for quick
summaries about the data frame.
```{python}
df.shape
df.describe()
df.isnull().sum()
```

What are the unique values of `descriptor`?
```{python}
df.descriptor.unique()
```

## Using Appache `Arrow` Library

To read and export data efficiently, leveraging the Apache `Arrow`
library can significantly improve performance and storage efficiency,
especially with large datasets. The IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
file format in the context of Apache Arrow is a key component for
efficiently sharing data between different processes, potentially
written in different programming languages. Arrow's IPC mechanism is
designed around two main file formats:

+ Stream Format: For sending an arbitrary length sequence of Arrow
record batches (tables). The stream format is useful for real-time
data exchange where the size of the data is not known upfront and can
grow indefinitely.
+ File (or Feather) Format: Optimized for storage and memory-mapped
access, allowing for fast random access to different sections of the
data. This format is ideal for scenarios where the entire dataset is
available upfront and can be stored in a file system for repeated
reads and writes.


Apache Arrow provides a columnar
memory format for flat and hierarchical data, optimized for efficient
data analytics. It can be used in Python through the `pyarrow`
package. Here's how you can use Arrow to read, manipulate, and export
data, including a demonstration of storage savings.


First, ensure you have pyarrow installed on your computer (and
preferrably, in your current virtual environment):
```
pip install pyarrow
```


Feather is a fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use binary file format for
storing data frames, optimized for speed and efficiency, particularly
for IPC and data sharing between Python and R.
```{python}
df.to_feather('data/rodent_22_23.feather')
```

Read the feather file back in:
```{python}
dff = pd.read_feather("data/rodent_22_23.feather")
dff.shape
```

Benefits of Using Feather:

+ Efficiency: Feather is designed to support fast reading and writing
of data frames, making it ideal for analytical workflows that need to
exchange large datasets between Python and R.
+ Compatibility: Maintains data type integrity across Python and R,
ensuring that numbers, strings, and dates/times are correctly handled
and preserved.
+ Simplicity: The API for reading and writing Feather files is
straightforward, making it accessible to users with varying levels of
programming expertise.
+ By using Feather format for data storage, you leverage a modern
approach optimized for speed and compatibility, significantly
enhancing the performance of data-intensive applications.
