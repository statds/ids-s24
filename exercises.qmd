# Exercises

1. **Git basics and GitHub setup**
  Learn the Git basics and set up an account on GitHub if you do not
  already have one. Practice the tips on Git in the notes. By going
  through the following tasks, ensure your repo has at least 10
  commits, each with an informative message. Regularly check the
  status of your repo using `git status`. The specific tasks are:
    1. Clone the class notes repo to an appropriate folder on your computer.
    1. Add all the files to your designated homework repo from
    GitHub Classroom and work on that repo for the rest of the problem.
    1. Add your name and wishes to the Wishlist; commit.
    1. Remove the `Last, First` entry from the list; commit.
    1. Create a new file called `add.qmd` containing a few lines of
    texts; commit.
    1. Remove `add.qmd` (pretending that this is by accident); commit.
    1. Recover the accidently removed file `add.qmd`; add a long line
  (a paragraph without a hard break); add a short line (under 80
  characters); commit.
    1. Change one word in the long line and one word in the short
  line; use `git diff` to see the difference from the last commit;
  commit.
    1. Play with other git operations and commit.
  

1. **Contributing to the Class Notes**
    1. Create a fork of the notes repo into your own GitHub account.
    1. Clone it to your local computer. 
    1. Make a new branch to experiment with your changes.
    1. Checkout your branch and add your wishes to the wish list; push
    to your GitHub account.
    1. Make a pull request to class notes repo from your fork at
    GitHub. Make sure you have clear messages to document the changes.

1. **Monty Hall**
   Write a function to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem through
   simulation. The function takes two arguments `ndoors` and
   `ntrials`, representing the number of doors in the experiment and
   the number of trails in a simulation, respectively. The function
   should return the proportion of wins for both the switch and
   no-switch strategy. Apply your function with 3 doors and 5 doors,
   both with 1000 trials. Include sufficient text around the code to
   explain your them.

1. **Approximating $\pi$**
   Write a function to do a Monte Carlo approximation of $\pi$. The
   function takes a Monte Carlo sample size `n` as input, and returns
   a point estimate of $\pi$ and a 95% confidence interval. Apply your
   function with sample size 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000. Repeat the experiment 
   1000 times for each sample size and check the empirical probability that the
   confidence intervals cover the true value of $\pi$. Comment on
   the results.

1. **Google Billboard Ad**
   Find the first 10-digit prime number occurring in consecutive
   digits of $e$. This was a [Google recruiting
   ad](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/news/2004-10-13/google/).

1. **Game 24**
   The [math game 24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game) is one of the
   addictive games among number lovers. With four randomly selected cards form
   a deck of poker cards, use all four values and elementary arithmetic
   operations ($+-\times /$) to come up with 24. Let $\square$ be one of
   the four numbers. Let $\bigcirc$ represent one of the four operators.
   For example, 
   \begin{equation*}
    (\square \bigcirc \square) \bigcirc (\square \bigcirc \square)
   \end{equation*}
   is one way to group the the operations.
   1. List all the possible ways to group the four numbers.
   1. How many possibly ways are there to check for a solution?
   1. Write a function to solve the problem in a brutal force way. The
   inputs of the function are four numbers. The function returns a list
   of solutions. Some of the solutions will be equivalent, but let us
   not worry about that for now.

1. The NYC motor vehicle collisions data with documentation is available from
   [NYC Open
   Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95).
   The raw data needs some cleaning. (JY: Add variable name cleaning next year.)
    1. Use the filter from the website to download the crash data of January
       2023; save it under a directory `data` with an informative name
	   (e.g., `nyc_crashes_202301.csv`).
	1. Get basic summaries of each variable: missing percentage; descriptive
       statistics for continuous variables; frequency tables for discrete
       variables.
	1. Are the `LATITUDE` and `LONGITIDE` values all look legitimate? If not
       (e.g., zeroes), code them as missing values.
	1. If `OFF STREET NAME` is not missing, are there any missing `LATITUDE` and
	   `LONGITUDE`? If so, geocode the addresses.
	1. (Optional) Are the missing patterns of `ON STREET NAME` and `LATITUDE` the same?
       Summarize the missing patterns by a cross table. If `ON STREET NAME` and
       `CROSS STREET NAME` are available, use geocoding by intersection to fill
	   the `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE`.
	1. Are `ZIP CODE` and `BOROUGH` always missing together? If `LATITUDE` and
       `LONGITUDE` are available, use reverse geocoding to fill the `ZIP CODE`
       and `BOROUGH`.
	1. Print the whole frequency table of
		`CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1`. 
	   Convert lower cases to uppercases and check the frequencies again.
	1. Provided an opportunity to meet the data provider, what suggestions do
       you have to make the data better based on your data exploration
       experience?

1. Except the first problem, use the cleaned data set with missing geocode
   imputed (`data/nyc_crashes_202301_cleaned.csv`).
    1. Construct a contigency table for missing in geocode (latitude and
       longitude) by borough. Is the missing pattern the same across borough?
       Formulate a hypothesis and test it. 
	1. Construct a `hour` variable with integer values from 0 to 23. Plot the
       histogram of the number of crashes by `hour`. Plot it by borough.
	1. Overlay the locations of the crashes on a map of NYC. The map could be a
       static map or Google map.
	1. Create a new variable `injury` which is one if the number of persons
       injured is 1 or more; and zero otherwise. Construct a cross table for
       `injury` versus borough. Test the null hypothesis that the two variables are
       not associated.
	1. Merge the crash data with the zip code database.
	1. Fit a logistic model with `injury` as the outcome variable and covariates
       that are available in the data or can be engineered from the data. For
       example, zip code level covariates can be obtained by merging with the
       zip code database.
	   
1. Using the cleaned NYC crash data, perform classification of `injury` with
   support vector machine and compare the results with the benchmark from
   regularized logistic regression. Use the last week's data as testing data.
    1. Explain the parameters you used in your fitting for each method.
	2. Explain the confusion matrix retult from each fit.
	3. Compare the performance of the two approaches in terms of accuracy,
       precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.


1. The [NYC Open Data of 311 Service Requests](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) contains
   all requests from 2010 to present. We consider a subset of it with request
   time between 00:00:00 01/15/2023 and 24:00:00 01/21/2023. The subset is
   available in CSV format as `data/nyc311_011523-012123_by022023.csv`. Read the
   data dictionary to understand the meaning of the variables,
    1. Clean the data: fill missing fields as much as possible; check for
       obvious data entry errors (e.g., can `Closed Date` be earlier than
       `Created Date`?); summarize your suggestions to the data curator in
       several bullet points.
    1. Remove requests that are not made to NYPD and create a new variable
       `duration`, which represents the time period from the `Created Date` to
       `Closed Date`. Note that `duration` may be censored for some
       requests. Visualize the distribution of uncensored `duration` by
       weekdays/weekend and by borough, and test whether the distributions
       are the same across weekdays/weekends of their creation
	   and across boroughs.
    1. Define a binary variable `over3h` which is 1 if `duration` is greater
       than 3 hours. Note that it can be obtained even for censored `duration`.
	   Build a model to predict `over3h`.
	   If your model has tuning parameters, justify their choices. Apply
       this model to the 311 requests of NYPD in the week of 01/22/2023. Assess
       the performance of your model.
    1. Now you know the data quite well. Come up with a research question of
       interest that can be answered by the data, which could be analytics or
       visualizations. Perform the needed analyses and answer your question.

1. **NYC Rats**
Rats in NYC are widespread, as they are in many densely populated
areas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rats_in_New_York_City). As of 
October 2023, NYC dropped from the 2nd to the 3rd places in the 
annual ["rattiest city" list](https://www.orkin.com/press-room/top-rodent-infested-cities-2023#)
released by a pest control company. In 
the 311 Service Request Data, there is one complain type `Rodent'. 
Extract all the requests with complain type `Rodent', created 
between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023. Save them into a 
csv file named `rodent_2022-2023.csv`.
    1. Are there any complains that are not closed yet?
    1. Are there any complains with a closed data before the
    created date?
    1. How many agencies were this complain type reported to?
    1. Summarize the missingess for each variable.
    1. Summarize a frequency table for the `DESCRIPTOR` variable, 
    and summarize a cross table by year.
    1. Which types of 'DESCRIPTOR' do you think should be included
    if our interest is rodent sighting?
    1. Take a subset of the data with the descriptors you chose and
    summarize the response time by borough.
