## Handling Spatial Data with `GeoPandas`

This section was written by Pratham Patel.

### Introduction and Installation

Hello! my name is Pratham Patel and I am a Senior due to graduate this 
semster with a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Mathematics/Statistics 
with a Computer Science minor. I hope to gain skills in using various 
different packages of Python in this course, as well as understand 
even more about the Data Science field. An example of learning new 
Python packages is the topic I will present today on the `geopandas` 
package. GeoPandas is an extension of the `pandas` package to support 
geographic data in its dataframes.

The GeoPandas packaage can be installed via the terminal using any of the following commands.

The documentation recommends:
`conda install -c conda-forge geopandas`

Standard conda install:
`conda install geopandas`

Using pip:
`pip install geopandas`
